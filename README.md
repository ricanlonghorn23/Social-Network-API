# Luis's Social Network Web Application API (Module 18 NoSQL)

## This Challenge contains Luis's Social Network Web Application API to include the following functions:

- Allows my social network web application to use the MongoDB database so that my Social network website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Installation

- npm init -y
- npm install express mongoose
- npm install --save-dev nodemon

## Usage

1. Start server:

- Open a new Git Bash terminal
- Go to Social-Network-API directly
- Once in Social-Network-API directly type 'code .'
- Once VS Code pulls up open the Git Bash terminal within VS Code and type 'npm start'(At this point, the server is running and you should get the message that states "API server running on port 3001!")
